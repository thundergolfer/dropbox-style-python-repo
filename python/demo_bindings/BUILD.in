# TODO(Jonathon): Benjamin P from Dropbox says the exe and runfiles can be copied directly to most Linux
#                 machines, but how is that actually done at Dropbox? See: # https://youtu.be/BnYUn7slfgk?t=862
#                 I tried using Bazel's zipper but it ignores the runfiles. Do they have a small bit of custom Starlark to
#                 to pkg up things?
