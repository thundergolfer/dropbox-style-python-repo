# Real Python - Python Bindings Sample Code Repo

This is the repo to accompany the [Python Bindings](https://realpython.com/python-bindings-overview/) article.

To be able to run the code, you must first install the requirements:

```console
$ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This should be done inside a virtual environment.

Once that is installed, you can use the invoke tool mentioned in the article to build and run the tests. See the tasks.py file or run invoke --list to get more details.
