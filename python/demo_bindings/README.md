Code from [Python Bindings](https://realpython.com/python-bindings-overview/) article.

To be able to run the code, you must first install the requirements:

```console
$ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This should be done inside a virtual environment.

Once that is installed, you can use the `invoke` tool mentioned in the article (`pip install invoke`) to build and run the tests. See the `tasks.py` file or run `invoke --list` to get more details.
