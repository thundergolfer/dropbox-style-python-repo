# TODO(Jonathon): Should be able to copy the macro out of https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/4e19317ecdf55ff5e771864256a52d30d0743856/Tools/rules.bzl
# and modify it so that it works with the Dropbox rules.
#
# It's cool that Cython already has Bazel integration.
# UPDATE: Jason Machalski points at that they have https://github.com/dropbox/altgrpc/blob/master/dropbox/grpc/python/dbx_pyx_library.bzl#L149
#         and that he'll work on moving it into the dbx rules.
